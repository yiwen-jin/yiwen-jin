## About Me

Hello, and welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Management Science at the [Operations and Logistics Division](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/operations-and-logistics), UBC Sauder School of Business. My advisors are [Yichuan Ding](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/yichuan-daniel-ding), [Mahesh Nagarajan](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/mahesh-nagarajan), [Steven Shechter](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/steven-shechter). 

**Update: I will join the Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary as an assistant professor in July 2024.**

My primary areas of interest lie in healthcare operations management, data analytics, and behavioral queueing. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven methods to facilitate innovative solutions in the healthcare delivery process, from emergency departments to operating rooms. I have developed and applied empirical, behavioral queueing, optimization, and machine learning techniques with complex healthcare datasets. I aim to harness these tools to improve healthcare delivery and generate meaningful insights to inform better policy and decision-making in collaboration with frontline healthcare practitioners. My research has been acknowledged with the [2023 POMS College of Healthcare Operations Management Best Paper Award](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xin-david-ding-5b5b618_conference-education-poms-activity-7067906007045156864-xIVs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). I am also interested in company diversity, sustainability, supply chain management and open to other fields in operations management. 

Research interests: archival-based studies in financial and managerial accounting - with special focuses on climage change, supply chain management, political costs, executive compensation, etc.

Prior to joining UBC, I obtained Bachelor in Economics and Mathematics from Wuhan University.


In the realm of teaching, I have a proven track record in delivering high-quality education, particularly in business analytics. My commitment to teaching excellence has been recognized through a strong evaluation score of 4.8/5.0 and the 2023 UBC Paul Chwelos Memorial Graduate Scholarship of Teaching Excellence.
